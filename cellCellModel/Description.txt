NB if want to look at wound area before wounding - just comment out stuff inside initialiseFibreBoxes, if(wounded==true)
NB newMatrix - records zeros for everything outside wound area
	allFibreBoxes - records all matrix
$ If want to have a starting matrix can put IMT = "SwirlyMatrixOriginal.txt" etc.
$ Removed all binary files
The "OldMatrix" is for recording the full matrix details in the run prior to wounding - where original beforeWound matrix is generated.

Found a bug with proliferation
Need a while loop rather than "if" and relate it to "dividing"
